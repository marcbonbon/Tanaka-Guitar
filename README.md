The website consists of five main pages: the home page, gallery page, 
about us page, member page, and contact us page. The home page features 
a promotional banner with a carousel that includes interactive buttons on 
both sides. It also provides information on categories and brands. The 
categories are interactive buttons that, when pressed, lead to specific 
galleries sorted by category. The brands section is not interactive. On the 
gallery page, you can find a list of all guitars, each displaying the name
and price. The about us page provides information about the store's history, 
including a dummy image for illustrative purposes. The member page includes 
a registration form where users can enter their name, email, gender, address, 
country, daily newsletter preference, and agree to the terms and conditions. 
The form applies validation methods, prompting users to fill in all required 
information before proceeding. For email validation, the system checks for the 
presence of "@" and ".com". If the user fails to select a gender or daily newsletter 
preference, they will be prompted to make a selection. Additionally, users are 
required to check the terms and conditions box. The contact page displays the 
store's phone number, office hours, email address, store address, and social 
media links, along with two pictures. This project was done as a school project.
